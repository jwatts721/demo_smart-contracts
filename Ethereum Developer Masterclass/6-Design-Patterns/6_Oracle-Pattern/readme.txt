An Oracle is an interface between the blockchain and the real world. 
    A.K.A. 
        Off-chain data sources that are available to the blockchain for smart contracts.

    Basically, this is a way of reading external data into a Smart Contract. 

Example: 
    A smart contract is created for betting between teams that win. 
    An Oracle is the interface that connects the real world to the blockchain where the Smart Contract exists. 

Analogy: 
    The Oracle in The Matrix was the connection between the virtual world and the real world. 
    She knew about everything in the virtual world and the real world.
