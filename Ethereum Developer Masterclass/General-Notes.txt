Remix IDE:
Deployment tab is the most important to understand.
Environment: 
  - JavaScript VM (for TESTING, running local test blockchain in the browser)
  - Injected Web3
  - Web3 Provider

The JavaScript VM is used for testing in a local blockchain running within the browser.
You can compile and deploy here without transaction fees.
This test blockchain comes with dummy wallet accounts in the "Accounts" dropdown.
Just like Ganache CLI, Hardhat and Truffle provide a local test blockchain.
All accounts default to 100 ETH as default. 

MetaMask:
- Web3 Based wallet
These are light nodes within the network.
Unlike full nodes which are a full copy of the Ethereum blockchain.
This allows use to run functions on the "light" node.

Types of Accounts on Ethereum:
- Unlike Bitcoin, which only has one type of account because Bitcoin is the only asset,
Ethereum has Externally Owned Accounts and Contract Accounts.
Externally Owned Accounts = accounts in our wallets, owned by users
    Has a public and a private key
Contract Accounts = Accounts for Smart Contracts
    Only has a public key, there is no private key

Types of Networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet (the main Ethereum network, fees apply)

    Local Test Network 
        - local blockchain in isolated environment - no access from the outside
        - each test account comes starts with 100 ETH 
- JavaScript Network
- Ganache
- Hardhat
- Truffle Develop

    Public Test Networks 
        - best for testing in the public space, particulary for teams of developers
        - requires obtaining ETH from test faucets
- JavaScript Network
- Rinkeby TestNet
- Kovan TestNet 
- Ropsten TestNet 
- Goerli TestNet 

NOTE: One wallet account address can be used for ALL networks. 
      You have to be careful that you DO NOT use real currency on a test network, because this currency will be lost.
      I would test with a different account than the one you use real currency.
