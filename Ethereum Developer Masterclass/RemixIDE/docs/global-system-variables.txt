Solidity has a set of predefined globals that are useful for giving information about the smart contract. 

A few examples:

- block
- msg
- tx

===============================================

function getValues() public view returns(
            uint blockNumber, 
            uint blockTimestamp, 
            address msgSender, 
            bytes calldata msgData // calldata helps get data from the blockchain
        ) {
    // Block number - uint
    // Block timestamp - uint
    // Message Sender - address   <-- the address of the person calling the function, not the person who created the contract
    // Message Data - bytes       <-- data being passed from the user to the function
    return (block.number, block.timestamp, msg.sender, msg.data);
}

Message Value: 
    - The message value that is paid into the contract is available in msg.value 

uint msgValue public;
function payToContract () payable public {
    msgValue = msg.value;
}

This function allows you to set the msgValue so you can inspect the value of the contract.
Note: The latest version of RemixIDE has native support for viewing the value of the contract.
      However, programatically you may require this to allow external applications to check the value of the contract.
