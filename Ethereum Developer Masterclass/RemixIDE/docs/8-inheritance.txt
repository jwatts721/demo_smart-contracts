INHERITANCE:

Same concept as inheritance in other object oriented programming languages.

Whenever you deploy child contracts, all parent contracts are also deployed.

Supported inheritance:
- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritance
- Parent, Grandparent Inheritance 

When inheriting a contract that has a constructor with parameters, you can declare the parameter and set the value
in the inheritance call. 

Example 1: 

    contract US is Country(9), India {
        ...
    }

Example 2: 

    contract US is Country, India {
        ...
        constructor() Country (9) public {

        }
    }

Example 3:
    contract US is Country, India {
        ...
        constructor (int _a) Country(_a * _a) public {    // can manipulate the argument before it gets into the contract

        }
    }
