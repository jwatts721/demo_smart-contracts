LIBRARIES: 

Libraries in Solidity work the same as they do in other programming languages. 

Addresses:
- Rules
- Security
- Complex Concepts

You must use the "library" keyword to define a library. 
Ensure that any library you create is audited and fully tested.

Example Library:
    library Math {
        function div(int a, int b) public pure returns (int) {
            require(b != 0, "The denominator is zero");
            return a / b;
        }
    }

After the implementation of the library is complete, you can use the "using" keyword to reference it. 

    using Math for int;
    ...
    return a.div(b);

More commonly, there are standardized libraries that have safe math operations.
