POLYMORHPHISM:

When contract has different behaviors in when different conditions exist.

Similar to how people behave different in different environments and settings. 



Example: 

    contract Poly {
        function sum(int a, int b) public pure returns (int) {
            return a + b;
        }

        function sum(int a, int b, int c) public pure returns (int) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    }

Notice how the function "sum" is defined twice. 
I will behave differently depending on the number of arguments that are passed in.
