TEST ENVIRONMENTS:
When testing deployments, you deploy on the Remix VM (Merge) network. 
This is a private blockchain in the browser.

All other Remix VM options are forks of the Mainnet from different regions. 
See documentation at https://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run.html#environment.

When the browser is reloaded, all data is lost and the blockchain is reset.


CONTRACT DEPLOYMENTS:
It is important to remember the following rules for deploying contracts:
- Anytime you deploy a contract, you must pay a gas fee
- Contracts deployed on the blockchain are immutable. They cannot be changed.
- Everytime you deploy a contract, it receives a new unique contract address.
  Since the contracts are immutable, changed code will be referenced on the blockchain
  as a new contract.
