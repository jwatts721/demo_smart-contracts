GAS GRIEFING EXPLOITS

When an attacker causes a contract to revert because not enough GAS is sent.
This is caused by attacker contracts where the "receive" function contains malicious code. 
This will cause all subsequent calls to the contract to fail because of a single hung transaction.
This will in turn cause a Denial of Service against the contract. 

The attacker contract uses the "receive" function to spend as much gas as possible. 
The malicious "receive" function contains mathmatical operations to cause revert failures. 


EIP559
- Example Code:
    A bid that is lower than the highest bid triggers the revert.
    The malicious contract has code in the "receive" function to force higher gas amounts
    which causes the contract trying to send funds to be inaccessible to new users.
