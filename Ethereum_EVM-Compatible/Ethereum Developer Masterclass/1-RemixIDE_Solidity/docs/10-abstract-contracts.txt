ABSTRACT CONTRACTS:

Abstract contacts work the same as abstract classes in other object oriented programming languages.

- These contracts cannot be executed independently, they must be referenced from normal contracts
- Behaviors are defined in this contract to be inheritted
- Abstract contracts should be marked as "abstract"
- Functions defined without implementation should be marked "virtual".
  Once you have at least one function that doesn't have an implementation, 
    the contract must be marked "abstract"
- Abstract contracts cannot be deployed directly

abstract contract Ab {
    int public a;
    int public b;
    function abc() public { // function declaration
        a = 13; // function implementation
        b = 15;
    }

    function def() public virtual view returns (string memory);
}
