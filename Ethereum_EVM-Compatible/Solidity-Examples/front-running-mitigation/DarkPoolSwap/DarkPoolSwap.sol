Additional Examples:
Swapping BNT for DAI:
Modify the swapTokens function to accept BNT tokens and swap them for DAI.
Adjust the calculateInjAmount function accordingly.

Multiple Token Swaps:
Extend the contract to handle more tokens (e.g., ETH, USDC, etc.).
Implement logic to perform multi-token swaps within the dark pool.

Slippage Tolerance:
Add slippage tolerance checks to ensure the swap doesnâ€™t result in significant price slippage.
Revert the transaction if the slippage exceeds a predefined threshold.

Flash Loan Integration:
Combine flash loans with dark pool swaps for even more complex arbitrage opportunities.


Remember that real-world implementations require robust error handling, security audits, 
and integration with actual dark pool providers. Always exercise caution and thoroughly 
test your smart contracts before deploying them in production
