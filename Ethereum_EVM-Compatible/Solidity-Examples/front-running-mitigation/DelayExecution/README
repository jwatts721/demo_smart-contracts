OFF-CHAIN TIMERS WITH ON-CHAIN VALIDATION
n this method, you set a timer in your off-chain application (e.g., JavaScript) to periodically trigger a function call in your smart contract.
Here’s an example in JavaScript:
JavaScript

function sendTx() {
    myContract.methods.myFunction().send();
}

setInterval(sendTx, 5 * 1000 * 60); // Execute every 5 minutes
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
In your Solidity smart contract, you can validate that the action is performed only if a certain time has passed since the last execution:
pragma solidity ^0.8;

contract MyContract {
    uint256 lastRun;

    function myFunction() external {
        require(block.timestamp - lastRun > 5 minutes, "Need to wait 5 minutes");
        // Perform the desired action
        lastRun = block.timestamp;
    }
}

Note that there’s a delay between sending a transaction from your app and the actual inclusion of that transaction in a block by a miner.






CHAINLINK KEEPERS
Chainlink Keepers is a decentralized service that acts like a cron job for executing functions in your contract at specified intervals.
It’s more expensive than the off-chain approach, but it’s fully decentralized.
You can configure it to execute your function at regular intervals, such as every 5 minutes.
