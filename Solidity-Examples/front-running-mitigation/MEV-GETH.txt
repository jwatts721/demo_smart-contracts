Maximal Extractable Value (MEV):
MEV refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production beyond the standard block reward and 
gas fees. It involves manipulating the order of transactions within a block.

Initially, MEV was associated with proof-of-work (PoW) mining, where miners controlled transaction inclusion, 
exclusion, and ordering. However, with Ethereum’s transition to proof-of-stake (PoS), validators now handle 
these roles.

MEV can be accrued by validators and independent network participants known as “searchers.”

Searchers run algorithms to detect profitable MEV opportunities and automatically submit transactions to the network.
Validators receive a portion of MEV because searchers pay high gas fees (which go to validators) for increased 
chances of transaction inclusion. Gas golfing (optimizing gas usage) is crucial for searchers to maintain profitability.



Crypto Arbitrage and MEV:
Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Arbitrage is a common MEV opportunity. Here’s how it works:
Suppose two DEXes offer a token at different prices.
A trader can buy the token on the lower-priced DEX and sell it on the higher-priced DEX in a single, 
atomic transaction.

Searchers compete to execute these arbitrage trades by submitting transactions with the highest gas price.
Validators benefit from gas fees paid by searchers for transaction inclusion.
Gas golfing techniques (e.g., minimizing gas usage) give searchers a competitive edge.

In summary, MEV-GETH (an upgrade to the go-ethereum client) facilitates efficient communication between 
miners and traders bidding for transaction inclusion. It plays a crucial role in crypto arbitrage 
by enabling searchers to profit from price discrepancies across DEXes
